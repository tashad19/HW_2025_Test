# Doofus Adventure

Doofus Adventure is a 3D platform survival game where you guide Doofus across disappearing pulpits while trying to score as high as possible. Each pulpit exists only for a short time and a new one spawns adjacent to the previous one. If the player falls, the game ends and the game over screen appears.

## Game Rules

### Objective

### Core Rules
- Only two pulpits can exist at any time
- Each pulpit has a random lifetime
- A new pulpit spawns when the time for the previous one reaches the spawn threshold
- Score increases when the player steps onto a new pulpit
- Falling results in game over and the game over scene appears
- High score is tracked across attempts

## How to Play
